As a data analyst in the marketing analyst team, the objective is to develop a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The study follows the data analysis process, encompasses the steps of asking relevant questions, preparing the data, processing and analyzing it, sharing insights, and suggesting actionable recommendations.

This article specifically addresses the initial question of understanding the differences between annual members and casual riders. By leveraging data analytics techniques, the study aims to uncover key insights that can inform targeted marketing tactics and drive the conversion of casual riders into annual member.

## Tools used in Analysis
- Data Cleaning: Microsoft Excel 
- Data Analysis: Microsft SQL Server 
- Visualization: Tableau Public

## Data Analysis Process
### Ask Phase:
To address the business task of understanding how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, the following questions will guide the analysis:

- Percentage of Casual Riders vs Annual Members
- Proportion of Rides by Bike Type
- Percentage of Rides per Month
- Number of Rides per Day
- Average Ride Duration by Day (in minutes)
- Frequency of Rides per Hour
- Percentage of rides per Season
- Proportion of rides in Each Time Zone
  
### Prepare Phase:
- The dataset used for this project is public data provided by Motivate International Inc. It consists of monthly files covering the period from January 2022 to December 2022. 
- Each file within the dataset contains 13 columns related to the bike rides. 
- These columns provide detailed information about each ride, including the ride ID, rideable type, start and end station ID’s and locations, coordinates, and membership type.

### Process Phase:
#### Data Cleaning in Excel:

During the process phase, the data cleaning steps were carried out in [Microsoft Excel](https://github.com/Tayyaba-Abro/Case-Study-Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis/tree/main/Excel-clean-data). The following actions were performed: 
- **Checking for Duplicates:** The duplicate values were examined using built-in “Remove Duplicates” feature in Excel. This helped ensure data integrity and eliminate any duplicated entries.
- **Validating Column Values:** The values in specific columns, such as rideable_type and member_casual, were verified to ensure consistency and accuracy. The only valid values, including classic_bike, docked_bike, electric_bike for rideable_type, and casual, member for member_casual, were retained.
- **Removing Blank Values:** The data set was checked for incomplete or blank values across all columns. Rows with missing values, particularly in columns like start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, and end_station_id, were removed to ensure data completeness.
- **Removing Unwanted Columns:** Columns start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, and end_lng, which were not relevant to the analysis, were removed from each file to streamline the dataset and focus on the essential variables.
- **Adding the Ride Length Column:** A new column named “ride_length” was added to calculate the duration of each ride. The value in the ride_length column was obtained by subtracting the started_at timestamp from the ended_at timestamp.
- **Setting the Time Format:** The ride_length column was formatted as “HH:MM:SS” using the “Format > Cells > Time > 37:30:55” option in Excel. This ensured that the ride duration was presented in a standardized time format.
- **Applying Conditional Formatting:** Conditional formatting was applied to the ride_length column to highlight ride lengths that fell outside the desired range. Specifically, any ride length values less than 00:01:00 (one minute) or greater than 24:00:00 (24 hours) were formatted differently, making them easily identifiable for further analysis or potential removal.
- **Sorting the Table:** The table was sorted in ascending order based on the started_at column to ensure data consistency.
By cleaning data in Excel, the dataset was refined, inconsistencies were addressed, and the ride length information was formatted appropriately for subsequent analysis.

#### Data Transformation in SQL
For data transformation, data processing was performed in SQL Server. The data from each month, spanning from January to December 2022, was imported and merged into a single table called “Annual_trip_data_2022”.The steps involved in this process are as follows:

- **Importing Data:** The monthly files containing the ride data were imported into SQL Server.
- **Merging Data:** A new table named “Annual_trip_data_2022” was created to store the consolidated data for the entire year.The data from tables were merged into the “Annual_trip_data_2022” table using the UNION ALL statement. SQL Query: [Merge Data](https://github.com/Tayyaba-Abro/Case-Study-Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis/blob/main/1.%20Merge%20Data.sql) 
- **Manipulate Data:** After merging data, a new table named “analyze_annual_trip_data” was generated. This table includes additional columns such as “month,” “day,” “hour,” and “duration_minutes” to facilitate the comparison and analysis of ride frequencies.
